She had two troubled marriages, two wicked husbands, in-laws who were not favourably disposed towards her, and series of unpleasant experiences. Yet, grace spoke out for her and God favoured her. It must be noted that she was not giving up; she kept pressing forward despite her disadvantaged position. Finally, she was pregnant for Judah and it was a set of twins. For some reason at delivery, one twin brought out his hand and drew it back. Then the other twin took his place and came out first, thereby inheriting the double portion. This breaking out put Perez in line as the ancestor of Jesus Christ. The position that could have been Zerah’s was taken up by Perez because Zerah drew back while Perez pushed forward. Tamar would not give up on her family and her happiness. She pushed until she broke forth. Perez seemed to have taken her spirit: he maximised the opportunity that opened for him by grace. Sometimes situations of life attempt to pull us back. Like Zerah you have held out your hand ready to receive the trophy. But something seems to pull you back at every attempt. Maybe it is a weakness or familial trend. The grace of the Lord is available today to give you the needed push. It is time to break out of obscurity into the limelight.",

He knows too well they won’t go down well in his tummy. He will wait. Also, He does not want to be too late and settle for overripe and spoilt ones. So, he must be exact. As soon as they are ripe, he gets down to business, peeling them to eat. There is a meeting point between God’s Word and a man’s life. God’s word had gone ahead of Joseph concerning his prosperity but he could not actualise it at the time. It was not yet “ripe for eating”. He had to wait. He waited and life happened to him. He waited until he was fully trained to cope with the challenges of leadership and his heart had been helped concerning forgiveness. But as soon as the time of the Word came, it was activated to fulfil its purpose. Nothing in the whole of the universe could stop its fulfilment. Nothing can stop the timely word except you. The boy was alert to know when the banana is ripe: keep vigilance to know when the promise materialises. The boy was also precise about time. Never wait until the word has passed.

Such were the words of command of Jesus in the days of His flesh. You will hear things like, “straightaway” “immediately” “suddenly”. No timeline, they happen before your mind can fathom it. And that is the word of command He spoke to this helpless man. This man had been waiting for the word of promise, the troubling of water for 38 years to no avail! The Word Himself showed up.

This is due to our carelessness and inability to keep our focus on Jesus. If we will be humble, repent and forsake our sins, Jesus is still here to restore us back to our original relationship with Him. No matter how bad the scar, He has the cure for our backsliding and He is willing to restore. Those who will not recover are the ones who have allowed pride to prevent them from repenting.\n\nJesus desires to restore us back to Him in His glory. He knew in spite of the grievous fall of Peter when he denied Him three times, that there was a strong passion of devoted love for Christ in his heart. And therefore, Jesus did not hesitate to entrust to him the care of His sheep and lambs. In the same way, the Lord Jesus will take the broken pieces of any life that will come to Him, and with His skilful and tender touch will remake it into something useful and beautiful in His service.\n\nDo not allow the devil to rob you of this golden privilege to come back to your first love. Do not wait until the wound of sin has festered before you cry out to the Lord for restoration. And if your wound seems so big, it is still amenable to healing by the hand of Jesus. Come back home today: His outstretched arm is waiting.\n\nAction plan: You cannot hide from your Maker.

Paul wrote that they are manifested (Galatians 5:19). The devil no longer hides them. Tackling this evil is a multi-level, multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary issue. But Jesus makes it simple by choosing to find the root cause: the seed of sin. Sin has grown its tap roots into the lives of men and springs up all kinds of branches, leaves and fruits. Sin has deprived us of a place with God and the needed rest for our soul. It gives Christ joy to fulfil this purpose: to destroy the root of sin.\n The root is the source of life to the tree.

Tired from secular life. 'I am too busy to study the word'. And what do we have to show for that busy life? While we must be about our daily business in life, we must remember that what is of eternal consequence is what we do with our soul, what we do for God, and how we use our God-given talents and opportunities for kingdom value.

If we will hear the truth, we must move away from the noises at the front of the judgment hall where there are mixed multitudes. We must desire like Pilate to interrogate Jesus in the inner chamber. and talk privately with Jesus like Pilate did. Finally, what is the truth? Pilate did not wait to hear the answer before rushing out to the front hall of cacophony. The truth is simple; it is not complicated. The truth is the Person of Jesus. Whatever He commands you is the undiluted truth: do it. And this is found in His word. May the Holy Spirit enlighten our spirit to be set free by the knowledge of Jesus.",

He had completed every task with intention and diligently fulfilled all that was written about Him in the scriptures. The Greek word translated \"It is finished\" is \"Tetelestai\" whose root word means to bring to an end. This word is used in business dealings to imply the debt is fully paid. In the judgement and the court system it means the sentence is fully served. In military settings, it is a declaration that the battle has been fully won. Jesus Christ accomplished all of this as He hung on the cross. \nThe debt of sin that we owed has been fully paid. He was made sin for us and took the punishment, serving the sentence in our stead.

        "text": "So Martha was right in her statement to Jesus: “if You had been here, my brother would not have died”. If a life meets with Jesus before death, He will never experience death because the life of God in Him neutralises death. Absence from Jesus is the reason for death. Death is a state of spiritual separation from God. Separation from God brings sin, sorrow, sickness, shame and guilt. He said concerning Lazarus that he was only sleeping. Whoever sleeps will wake up again because sleep is a temporary, and not permanent, state of unconsciousness. Jesus is the preserver of life (life in life) and the restorer of life (life in death). By the life of Christ, we will not know death because He is our Life (John 14:6). He will preserve our bone from breaking and our soul from corruption. Look into your family life, marriage, career, finances, children, and declare the life of Christ. And peradventure, some good things are already dead in your life, the Lord Jesus can restore by His power over death. He is the Resurrection. He will make the dry bones rise again. In that confidence and realization, be ready to declare the life of Christ into all that is yours as you pray today. Don’t leave anything behind. Jesus is more than willing to bring life, sanity, joy and peace into all that has troubled your soul. It is time to rise again and shine because the Resurrection and the Life is right here",
        "thoughts": "Where is the sting of hell and death when the Resurrection and the Life is ever present with us?",
        "prayer": "Life has never been so good until I found the truth about the Lord Jesus. I call You into every area of my life",

        "text": "Many old buildings constructed during the colonial and postcolonial era had windows that were so large they could be mistaken for doors. A specialist conducting a ward round in a tertiary hospital was encouraged by his team members to go into the ward through one such window. He refused, saying, “I prefer to go in through the main entrance, introduce myself to the matron in the ward and state my business clearly”. This man clearly understood the difference between a door as an entrance and a window. A door is an entry point, a means of access into a building or a room. Anyone attempting to enter a building by any other means except the door can be accused of theft. In the same vein, there is only one access route into the grace and blessings the Lord has provided for His children. The Lord Jesus said in verse 7 of our passage today, “I am the door for the sheep”. Our focus verse says the sheep can go in and out and find pasture only by this door. Every other entrance becomes illegitimate and unacceptable. This is why we pray in the name of Jesus, not of any other person or personality. No one died for you except Jesus. Therefore, your allegiance must always be unto Him. You cannot please God except you come through Him. Every shortcut you take makes you only a thief whose identity can be questioned. Go through the right channel: Jesus.",

Any deviation from the given instructions nullifies the agreement to repair or replace the product within the stated period. When we come to church, we come to get instructions for our lives through the word of God. The rules have been set out on what to do and what to avoid. We have directions on how to relate with our fellow human beings. Guidance is provided on how to relate with God and even how to deal with the devil. As we live following the instructions provided, we find life much easier to deal with. If we follow the directions we have been given, we are able to conquer the world, the flesh and Satan even as they bring temptations our way. Finally, our faith is rekindled when we hear the word of God. (Romans 10:17). As we hear the instructions from the word and do them, we are blessed (James 1:25).

As men we have the natural tendency to worry about where our food, clothing and shelter would come from (Matthew 6: 25-28). But Jesus does not want us to spend our energy and time worrying about things that will happen in the future. This does not mean that we should not plan our lives and make necessary preparations, yet we must not torment ourselves today with fears of what may be tomorrow. Each day has its peculiar challenges, difficulties and trials. We should meet them with confidence in God. Our heavenly Father designed us to live a day at a time, so we should take care to suffer no more evils in one day than are necessarily attached to it. He who neglects the present for the future is acting contrary to God’s order and the dictate of sound wisdom. You always have a choice as to how you will spend the gift of the present day God has given you. If you use it wisely, it will bring fruits of greatness for you. What are the causes of your worries about tomorrow? The economy, poverty, disease, unfaithful brethren, disobedient children or a harsh employer?
