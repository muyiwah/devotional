She had two troubled marriages, two wicked husbands, in-laws who were not favourably disposed towards her, and series of unpleasant experiences. Yet, grace spoke out for her and God favoured her. It must be noted that she was not giving up; she kept pressing forward despite her disadvantaged position. Finally, she was pregnant for Judah and it was a set of twins. For some reason at delivery, one twin brought out his hand and drew it back. Then the other twin took his place and came out first, thereby inheriting the double portion. This breaking out put Perez in line as the ancestor of Jesus Christ. The position that could have been Zerah’s was taken up by Perez because Zerah drew back while Perez pushed forward. Tamar would not give up on her family and her happiness. She pushed until she broke forth. Perez seemed to have taken her spirit: he maximised the opportunity that opened for him by grace. Sometimes situations of life attempt to pull us back. Like Zerah you have held out your hand ready to receive the trophy. But something seems to pull you back at every attempt. Maybe it is a weakness or familial trend. The grace of the Lord is available today to give you the needed push. It is time to break out of obscurity into the limelight.",

He knows too well they won’t go down well in his tummy. He will wait. Also, He does not want to be too late and settle for overripe and spoilt ones. So, he must be exact. As soon as they are ripe, he gets down to business, peeling them to eat. There is a meeting point between God’s Word and a man’s life. God’s word had gone ahead of Joseph concerning his prosperity but he could not actualise it at the time. It was not yet “ripe for eating”. He had to wait. He waited and life happened to him. He waited until he was fully trained to cope with the challenges of leadership and his heart had been helped concerning forgiveness. But as soon as the time of the Word came, it was activated to fulfil its purpose. Nothing in the whole of the universe could stop its fulfilment. Nothing can stop the timely word except you. The boy was alert to know when the banana is ripe: keep vigilance to know when the promise materialises. The boy was also precise about time. Never wait until the word has passed. Lastly, the boy had to peel the banana to eat. If you do not activate the Word, you might suffer in the midst of plenty.",

Such were the words of command of Jesus in the days of His flesh. You will hear things like, “straightaway” “immediately” “suddenly”. No timeline, they happen before your mind can fathom it. And that is the word of command He spoke to this helpless man. This man had been waiting for the word of promise, the troubling of water for 38 years to no avail! The Word Himself showed up. The infirmed man’s lack of faith, lack of helper, slowness to act, all became irrelevant protocol when the Commander of God’s word got to the scene. And it was on the Sabbath day.

Trusting God is not just mere words that we say to massage our feelings. It is hope because we have seen him help us. As a believer you must have a testimony and always remind yourself of what the Lord has done for you, this helps you to be able to trust Him more.

This is due to our carelessness and inability to keep our focus on Jesus. If we will be humble, repent and forsake our sins, Jesus is still here to restore us back to our original relationship with Him. No matter how bad the scar, He has the cure for our backsliding and He is willing to restore. Those who will not recover are the ones who have allowed pride to prevent them from repenting.\n\nJesus desires to restore us back to Him in His glory. He knew in spite of the grievous fall of Peter when he denied Him three times, that there was a strong passion of devoted love for Christ in his heart. And therefore, Jesus did not hesitate to entrust to him the care of His sheep and lambs. In the same way, the Lord Jesus will take the broken pieces of any life that will come to Him, and with His skilful and tender touch will remake it into something useful and beautiful in His service.\n\nDo not allow the devil to rob you of this golden privilege to come back to your first love. Do not wait until the wound of sin has festered before you cry out to the Lord for restoration. And if your wound seems so big, it is still amenable to healing by the hand of Jesus. Come back home today: His outstretched arm is waiting.\n\nYou cannot hide from your Maker. Prayerfully come before Him to expose your spiritual state that needs healing.\n\nWhen Jesus picks up the broken pieces of your life, He makes them into a piece of fine art.\n\nLord Jesus, I turn to You from my backslidings.

He came with a purpose—to defeat sin in our lives. He came to destroy the power and hold of sin and to uproot it.\n The works of the devil are the works of the flesh. Paul wrote that they are manifested (Galatians 5:19). The devil no longer hides them. Tackling this evil is a multi-level, multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary issue. But Jesus makes it simple by choosing to find the root cause: the seed of sin. Sin has grown its tap roots into the lives of men and springs up all kinds of branches, leaves and fruits. Sin has deprived us of a place with God and the needed rest for our soul. It gives Christ joy to fulfil this purpose: to destroy the root of sin.\n The root is the source of life to the tree.

Tired from secular life. 'I am too busy to study the word'. And what do we have to show for that busy life? While we must be about our daily business in life, we must remember that what is of eternal consequence is what we do with our soul, what we do for God, and how we use our God-given talents and opportunities for kingdom value. Since Nicodemus had recognised Jesus as a great teacher, Jesus maximised the opportunity to tell him about eternal life. There are people who form your circle of influence.

Whoever sleeps will wake up again because sleep is a temporary, and not permanent, state of unconsciousness. \n\nJesus is the preserver of life (life in life) and the restorer of life (life in death). By the life of Christ, we will not know death because He is our Life (John 14:6). He will preserve our bone from breaking and our soul from corruption. Look into your family life, marriage, career, finances, children, and declare the life of Christ. And peradventure, some good things are already dead in your life, the Lord Jesus can restore by His power over death. He is the Resurrection. He will make the dry bones rise again. \n\nIn that confidence and realization, be ready to declare the life of Christ into all that is yours as you pray today. Don’t leave anything behind. Jesus is more than willing to bring life, sanity, joy and peace into all that has troubled your soul. It is time to rise again and shine because the Resurrection and the Life is right here",

It directs us to focus on the essence of worship, which is our heart’s attitude towards God. The Word teaches us to worship God with humility, gratitude and reverent fear, recognizing His holiness. By aligning our worship with the Word, we ensure that our expressions are pleasing to God and reflect His truth. By His word, we are taught that worship is not confined to a specific time or place but should be a continuous lifestyle. \n\nBeloved, as you meditate on the word and allow it to dwell within you richly, pause to worship God for the light He has shed on your heart.

They have no real joy, only apparent happiness. Inner peace is not a product of earthly acquisition; it is a function of a mind settled in God. To achieve this, first reconcile the past. Let God heal you from the guilt and shame of your past errors. Being reconciled with God, let His peace flood your heart. Also, affirm your confidence in the redemptive work by being continually thankful to God. \n\nSecondly, you need to accept the present situation. Denial is different from faith. Do not mix confession of faith with the denial of the obvious. When you accept the situation, it brings a platform for divine transformation. Rather than confusion, which is a product of denial, acceptance helps you to achieve an inner peace and clarity ready to wage war against everything that God has not planted but is troubling your life. It helps you to know your starting point for the purpose of moving forward. It is called being contented but not complacent. \n\nLastly, you must see a calm future before you. The troubling and raging seas of today will soon become a thing of the past. Beloved, the past and the present propel the future. Inner peace is for those who have dealt with the yesterday and today of their lives for the purpose of achieving tomorrow's peace and tranquillity.",

The head should not lack and hence all the necessities are provided without an excuse.  \n\nBenefits are given in order to make it easier for the head to perform its functions. There will be no excuse for non-performance by the head or leader at any time. The head thinks for the rest of the body and directs their affairs. \n\nAs long as the head (the brain) is intact, it can move all other parts of the body in whatever direction it desires. If the brain fails to work, the limbs cannot move, the eyes cannot see, the ears cannot hear.People live with transplanted body organs but there is yet to be a survivor of a transplanted brain. \n\nGod has made you the head; so speak to the body of problems. Stay in the position of the head and speak to the situation. Tell it to obey you as the head. Be in charge; be in control. Tell the storm it’s time to stop troubling your career, your business, your family and finances. Re-order the course of the day. Restore order in the world of chaos.",

Again, Jesus replied that He was counting their sacrifices and noting them against the corresponding blessing. Note in His reply to Peter in verse 30, He pluralised all the things mentioned in verse 29. The things which the disciples left to follow Jesus in verse 29 were the seeds. But the multiplied goods mentioned in verse 30 were the fruits of their labour. Whatever they left for Jesus was multiplied in quantity and quality. What a good business! \n\nWhat have you left behind to serve Jesus? What do you think you lost because you decided to follow Jesus—friends, associates, wealth, fame, power?

The answer to the question is anyone who has great and uncommon faith touched Jesus. Faith draws His attention from above. Faith links to virtue and releases power from on high. Physical proximity to the Lord is not as effective as faith proximity in drawing attention and power from Him. \n\nThis story simply tells us that touching Jesus is based on some principles, not really an outward thing. The truth is that not all those who come to church really feel Him. The woman said in her heart “If only I can touch Jesus, I know I shall be whole”. What a resolute inward desire, not a hypocritical physical demonstration. This woman made Jesus her last and only stop. Is Jesus your only option in that challenge? The woman had faith in Jesus; she placed ultimate value on the ability of Jesus to deliver her. Her faith drew virtue from Jesus. \n\nLet your faith be so rested on the supremacy of Christ as the One with the power to do all things. There are many who pray but there are few who pray in faith. Though multitudes were forcefully pressing in on Jesus, most never touched Him. Place so much value on Jesus and let your heart cling to His power to save and deliver.",

While faith can move mountains, unforgiveness can hinder the prayer of faith.

Jesus made this clear to His disciples in John13:35 that the most telling identity of the Christian faith is not the message they preach but the life they live which is bursting forth with God’s love. The love which results from that lifestyle is captivating because the world neither knows the real definition of love nor has experienced it in its undiluted form. To them, love is defined by their damaged view of life. \n\nTo many, love is reciprocating another person’s good gesture. So, they love their friends and hate their enemies. That is not surprising. Others look for what they stand to gain from a friendship first before they show love or compassion. That is also not unexpected. But to love those who despise and persecute you is an uncommon attribute (Matthew 5:44). To care for people without expecting any direct reward from them is rare. To be genuinely concerned, pray for others, and seek their good is not a normal trait in this perverse world. \n\nThe world is starved of true love. God’s love perfectly fits the hollow in the heart of men. It is attractive because it is scarce. Be a carrier of Christ’s love.

Jesus was never distracted by success or failure; He always kept the sweet hour of prayer. What a life! A life described by countless retreats in solitary places where it was only Him and the Father. He had such an intimacy with the Father that governed all He did. He would ask the Father to show Him what to do. He never did anything that the Father had not already approved while He prayed. \n\nJesus enjoyed the Father’s love. A loving Father will always give fish and not stones. A loving Father communicates clearly to his sons and daughters. Also, the Father showed Him everything He did. There are deep secrets a man will not commit to strangers. There are family business secrets kept within the family line for generations. Strangers can be exalted to certain managerial levels but not beyond. The intricate workings of the company are reserved for the blood relations who are empowered to carry on for generations to come. \n\nAs sons and daughters of the Most High God, we are empowered in prayer to do all things through the strength infused into us by Jesus. We are also powered by the Holy Spirit to attain what will have been otherwise limited by our natural senses. Jesus sought the face of the Father daily to know the direction for the day, we must do the same for unprecedented success in life.",

        "text": "The verses above illustrate three things a believer must always do. First, we must always rejoice. Rejoicing is a positive state that reveals the condition of the soul. If indeed we have been redeemed and set free from the prison of sin and death, there must be a rejoicing in our soul. A life that is gloomy because of the current economic downturn has forgotten that it is only a season and seasons do change. But the redemption of our soul guarantees us eternal life with God. Let your soul be well-informed about who you are in Christ, and rejoice. \n\nSecondly, we are to always pray. Prayer should be made ceaselessly. When we cease to pray, we lose our defence and become open to the enemies’ attack. Prayerlessness connotes spiritual powerlessness. A believer who does not pray is a person who has lost relationship with the Lord. Nothing encourages a man like an answer to prayer. When you pray and see results, you are encouraged to pray again. Prayer makes us close to God. We look like the one we pray to. Prayer makes us far away from the world system and links us to a strong intimacy with God. \n\nLastly, be thankful always. Let the words: “Thank You Jesus!” be a song in your mouth every morning and your closing remarks at night. The more thankful you are, the more you will receive. The more you receive, the more prayerful you will become. The more results you see in prayers, the more your rejoicing before the Lord and His people.",

Another man was said to have locked himself up in a hotel room over the weekend and when his friends asked him what he was praying about, he simply replied: “I was only begging God to help me”. God is a Father: He cannot ignore the cry of a child for help. He is a life rescuer: He will always notice the shouts for help by a drowning man and rush to the site to rescue. Even wicked Ahab cried out to God for mercy and God noticed it (1 Kings 21:27-29). \n\nOur passage today says that Jabez cried out to God and God granted his request. Make your request know to Him today. Sometimes we need to be reminded that it is okay to be vulnerable before God. If truly He is our Father, which He is, then we should have the liberty to come to Him and cry aloud for help. After all, no father would see his child in pain and not do anything about it. It is time we stopped this show of empty strength when we are dying spiritually inside. When we accept that we are weak, God’s strength will be perfected in us. \n\nAre you dying in silence? Are you in pain and all hope seems lost? You don’t have to suffer in silence. God is interested in you. God is as close as your next cry for help. Do not focus on the complexity of the situation.

This means that righteousness attracts God’s favour over the life of an individual. \n\nWhile it is good to work hard, it is favour that births greatness. A life that has found favour with God and man will be a life that is familiar with honour. Such a person is celebrated for his productive life and efficiency. When you notice that among your colleagues (and even those who work harder than you), you have been selected to enjoy a privilege, recognise that God’s favour has found you. Notice that the angelic salutation to Mary emphasized how favoured she was among other qualified women to be chosen to carry the Messiah. \n\nJesus needed God’s favour to have a fulfilled earthly life and ministry.

First, the LORD says He will deliver you when you set your love on Him by dwelling in His secret place. This means that there is no way the enemy can hold you captive, no matter what their schemes or plans are. It also means that God will always make a way out for you. He will make a way for you out of shame and embarrassment. He will make a way for you out of bondage.  \n\nSecondly, God assures us that when we set our love on Him by means of dwelling in His secret place, He will also set us on high. A man of the secret place is a man who will enjoy exaltation among men. Jesus was a man of the secret place. Whenever He finished His secret-place business with the Father, all men would come looking for Him. If we will look for God, men will look for us, even from the secret place. When we dwell in the secret place of the Most High, He lifts us high because He draws us to Himself.  \n\nRise up today with this understanding, and know that the LORD has taken side with you because you dwell in His secret place.

Without faith, we cannot please God even in our prayers. Many people pray religiously without believing God that the prayers will be answered. They prayed so that they will not sound unconcerned about the issue at hand. They prayed because someone was leading them to do so. They prayed but not from the heart of faith. Such a prayer does not move God. It is an emotional exercise in futility.  \n\nThe most effective prayer is not in the length or vocabulary, but one done in faith. Believing is the key to receiving all that we want in prayer. Faith is the vehicle that you use to fetch your answers to prayer, therefore we must look deeply into our faith. When Jesus went about healing the sick, He always asked one question, “do you believe?”, because without faith then our prayers will never receive answers. The prayer of faith moves mountains. It makes a man speak things that are not as though they are. \n\nToday God is waiting for men who will dare to pray and believe Him for the miraculous. He is a big God and He wants people who will ask for big things in faith. If you worry after you have tabled your request to God, you may need to go and redo the prayers.

It is a cornerstone of a blessed life of prayer. A broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise (Psalms 51:17). In fact, God looks unto a man with contrite spirit who trembles at His word with a nod of approval. By prayer, we show our utmost dependence on God and thereby we give God the platform to express His power and display His glory in us. \n\nPeople who despise the heart of humility in prayer are the ones who say, “must you pray about everything?” To them, they can handle life and will only bother God when they are at their wits end. Prayer should not be treated as a chore or a tradition, prayer should be intentional and show we indeed need God. By humility, we trust God completely, surrendering and aligning with His will. It starts from the heart looking up to God for the next step to take. Like Jesus, we make moves, not because they are calculated, but because they are ordered by the Father. \n\nDo not appear before God like a professional prayer expert. God sees your heart and knows your frailty. Come with humility; worship Him and be in awe of His presence. Then He will make Himself known to you and lift you up.

We do not work in darkness; we walk in the light even in the night. \n\nNighttime is a time of terrors—a time of treason, plunder, robbery, and murder. But for the children of light, we are untouchable even in the night. “He who keeps Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps”. In Jesus, we have the true remedy against the fear that threatens the soul of men in the dark hour. Even in darkness, the Father of light is shining His light on us to guide and protect us from evil.

An effective intercessor is a burden bearer who often lays aside personal concerns to attend to the needs of others in the place of prayer. Such was the case of Zachariah in today’s reading. He had been many years without a child and was now well advanced in age. His wife was an old woman also and had been classified as barren. They had prayed for many years and had probably given up. Now he had been chosen to serve at the altar, bearing the needs of the people before God as he burnt incense in the Holy Place. \n\nHere we see an exchange of burden. While the priest was committed to doing his priestly duty God showed up to help him. He had laid aside his own personal burden of childlessness to pick up God’s burden for His people. While God was looking for a forerunner for His Son, Zechariah needed a son. So the exchange took place and everyone was happy. There is no burden so great that God cannot carry for you, If He could carry the weight of the entire world upon His shoulder, He will carry your burdens too. It is a privilege to be a burden-sharer with the Lord. \n\nIt is privileged fellowship with God rather than a weakness on His part. If He calls you to intercede for a life or a nation, it is because you are His friend like Abraham (Genesis 18:17-21).

You take courage in the Lord’s promises though the horizon does not seem to show any sign of them yet. That is how the deposit of God’s Spirit makes you a man of hope and great strength. No dead wood can catch fire, it needs first a little spark, then a little live coal. And when the wind of the Spirit blows, it will set it ablaze for a greater purpose.  As long as there is little strength in you, the Holy Spirit has something to fan to flame. If you stop sowing due to discouragement, you will have nothing to reap in harvest. If you give up trying because of failures and intimidations, you will have no celebration of victory at last. The wind of the Spirit is blowing your way, let it meet a spark of hope in you.",

The excuse of being a youth will not be tenable if we compare him with another youth, David, who slew a bear, a lion and a human giant.

What Lot saw as barren land turned out to be one filled with milk and honey. \n\nAre there waters covering your land preventing you from planting and receiving the harvest?

He looked up to the Father and would only do what the Father had completed in heaven. He only did what He saw the Father do. If you don’t want to embarrass yourself on life’s stage, always ask the Lord for direction no matter how easy the task seems.

Our attitude may be to boast about how morally upright we are without focusing on how the Lord has given us the grace to do His will. We are saved by grace and as such we have nothing to boast of. If grace was instrumental to our salvation, we need grace to maintain it. \n\nThere is such a thin line between legalism and understanding the significance of the saving grace. The grace of God over our lives is such an unmerited favour that gives us the ability to do the works of righteousness. The moralist thinks that he is good all by himself. But the best of his deeds are like a filthy rag before God. The Christian knows that the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus is what made him acceptable to God in the first place. Then the same grace is made available to help him do the will of God.  \n\nTake a moment to reflect on the rich grace of the Lord Jesus Christ on your life and give thanks to God for it.

Joshua wanted Israel to make up their minds as individuals whether they wanted to enlist in God’s service or not.

However, Joshua made it clear that for him and his household, they had already signed up for God—not backing out or backing down. \n\nTo be effective in our commitment to God, everyone must have the “terms and conditions” read to them like Joshua did. Our decision to follow the Lord must not be based on wrong assumptions that there will be no trying times. It must be based on the understanding that in the darkest of the storms, the Lord will lead us by the hand and take us safely home. Unfortunately, many preachers today gloss over the T&Cs of following Jesus. Thus when the endurance test commences, men begin to chicken out. \n\nIn the words of Jesus: “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).

There were moments of hardship when it really felt like God was not there for you. Times there were when heaven seemed closed and prayers unanswered. These moments could seem so long and could be so trying. Such times could be a divine call to look inwards and see where you have missed it. Or God could be calling your attention to some wayward lifestyle and excesses, wanting you to retrace your steps. \n\nThe present-day style of child rearing in many quarters frowns at firm punishment but this has come with dangerous consequences. It has resulted in soft-bred, spineless children with little or no resilience in hard times. In the same vein, thinking that the life of a Christian comprises only good times and no hardships is a lie from the pit of hell. Honestly speaking, corrections and punishments come our way in this life because the Lord is interested in our wellbeing. This rod is meant to help us get back on track quickly.  \n\nHope you were able to make the best of those trying moments.

We are commanded to live generously.   The 'Love your friend,' and 'Hate your enemy' mentality doesn’t have a place in us as true sons and daughters of the heavenly Father. Jesus challenged this wrong mentality when He commanded us to love our enemies (Matthew 5:44). This trumps whatever you may have learnt or heard from anyone differently. The Lord Himself disagrees with a vengeful life whatever the cause. Rather than spill out venom on your enemies, let their attitude bring out the best in you. Win them by love. Catch them unaware with acts of kindness and kind words. \n\nSo when someone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of kindness.

He designed the plan of salvation and executed it. He used the blood of Jesus to pay for the lost souls. Let us burst into praise to God for the salvation of our souls. God adopted us as His own children. This was possible through the blood of Jesus Christ. We deserved to die but received mercy from above. Be intentional as you offer praises to God. Daniel was intentional in his praises. He thanked God for his mercy and wisdom. He thanked God for his powerful works.  \n\nGod reveals profound mysteries beyond human understanding. God is light and darkness is not an obstacle to him. Conquer ignorance. Increase your knowledge of God. Be committed to the study of the Bible. Build your faith and confidence in him. Grow your spiritual life. Worship God as one who has full understanding of your maker.",

        "text": "There was a segment in the magazine Readers Digest some years ago called “Laughter, the Best Medicine.” It was a collection of jokes from different aspects of daily life that more often than not triggered a belly laugh once the reader got the joke. Research has shown that laughter does the body good. There is release of chemicals called endorphins which relieve pain and create a general sense of wellbeing. Energy level is raised, tension released, attitude changed and antibodies increased, strengthening the immune system.  \n\nDeep laughter is like an internal aerobic exercise because it makes you inhale more oxygen and stimulates your heart and circulation. No wonder our focus verse today refers to a merry heart as good medicine. Which is why the devil is prone to bring depressive thoughts that discourage and steal your joy. But the Lord desires His children to be joyful. The Lord Jesus said in John 10:10 (Amp.) The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).   \n\nThe Lord has come to bring joy to His people. Don’t wait for something or the other to happen before you experience His joy. While you are waiting for the fulfilment of God’s promises to you, make up your mind to enjoy life to the full.",

Who would believe her? More likely that they would condemn her for fornication. Thankfully, the angel revealed that her barren old relative Elizabeth was going to be a mother. \n\nA visit to Elizabeth was a welcome opportunity to leave town for a while and adjust to her new situation. She may have wondered how she would be received given her unmarried state. Again, the Lord prepared the grounds for her. Hearing her greeting, Elizabeth’s baby leaped in her womb and the Spirit of the Lord moved Elizabeth to understand the situation. She welcomed Mary with joy and words of encouragement that must have been like cold water to her thirsty soul. Finally, she had someone who could relate to her situation and willing to support her. \n\nThe Lord sometimes calls us to walk a lonely path as we seek to fulfil His mandate and follow His will.
