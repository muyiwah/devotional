He will bring all agitations over your life to a standstill. Whatever poses itself as an obstacle to your progress and joy will be crushed by God's mighty power (Isaiah 48:12-13). When you are completely yielded to God in your decision making, the First and the Last will place His right hand of power over you to grant you boldness, speed and success.

With electric power, the darkness of the night is pushed aside as light comes on. There is something about light that makes the heart lighter. At creation, the earth was covered in darkness till God spoke light into being. Then He separated the darkness from the light and made a distinction between day and night. This distinction has remained throughout the ages as we receive light form the sun in the daytime and from the moon at night. In fact, man has gone as far as to tap into the energy from the sun to power devices and even light up the night.  \n\nConsider then our focus verse for today - the Lord Himself will be our light, not the sun or moon. If the One who called the light we now enjoy into being says He Himself will be our Light, how great will that Light be! Nothing can be hidden from us when the Lord is our Light.

When you clean something that was initially dirty, there is a satisfying smile that follows. It is also worthy of note that without dirt, there will be no need to clean. Without mistakes and errors, there will be no need for an eraser or correction. Without sin, there will be no need for atonement by the blood.\n\nMen have devised different means of taking care of their sin. Some try to play down on it as if that will reduce its intensity or seriousness. They call it mistakes, shortcomings, weaknesses, but none of this has helped to take away sins or reduce their impact on their consciences. Others sacrifice animals but to what end? However, the blood of Jesus Christ, God’s only begotten Son, cleanses us from all sin. This is not about covering the sins but about wiping them and making the slate of our life clean again. What a detergent for the guilty stain of sin!\n\nThe blood of Jesus is here to make your life clean again. By His blood, we receive forgiveness of sin.

Confession here means open declaration of one’s trust and faith in Jesus as his Lord, Saviour, Master, and King. It is an indication that we are truly convinced about the Lordship of Christ.

What our heart believes must be declared by our mouth so others can feel us.\n\nIt goes without saying then that confession of Jesus should be a continual declaration for a Christian. Never hide your identity as a believer or else you are playing with the fire of compromise. Never fail to declare Him as Lord over all the new terrains, new day, new appointment, to new friends and acquaintances because that is where your daily salvation lies. When we open our mouths to put Him in His place of authority, Jesus occupies the driving seat of our life to prove His Saviourship to everyone watching our life.\n\nWhen we confess Him before men, He introduces us to the Father, to watch over us, the Holy Spirit to teach us, and the angels to run errands for our sake. 'Therefore, whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven' (Matthew 10:32-33).",

Their lifestyle and worldview became shaped by looking unto Jesus. His attitude of influence was so contagious that they desired to pray like He prayed, to work miracles like He did, and to live like He lived. The lifestyle of the Master commanded so much attention that people desired the beauty that His life demonstrated.

Men may even ride over us; things may not be going as we expect; the tides of life may be strong against us but the Lord will never leave us. When we are down, it is a time we are most vulnerable—liable to danger and weakness. If your corn of wheat is falling to the ground today, rejoice because the future is bright.

He is the encourager that gives hope to your weary soul. He is the life-giver that resurrects your long-abandoned dream of excellence. Like the Psalmist requested, when the Lord draws near to our soul, He will of necessity redeem it from destruction. When waters come into our soul to drown us, the Lord will deliver. When we sink into the mire where there is no standing, He will reach out to save us. When we are overcome by the overflowing floods of life, He will show up and lift us out of peril.\n\nDesist from weeping because your soul is damp. Come closer to the Sun of righteousness today.

He contrasted the secular leadership style in His explanation to His disciples: a leader must be humble enough to serve the people and be ready to give his life. Jesus washed the feet of His disciples to demonstrate a lesson in humility. People could hardly differentiate Him from His disciples by clothing, sitting position, or appearance. He lived among us, walked and worked here, felt our pains and partook of our sorrows.\n\nBe humble enough today to relate to persons you consider of lower degree.

All Christ needed was to discover a need in the life of someone. He never waited to be called upon by anybody to fill the gap. He was ever ready to show kindness to the Jews, who considered themselves as Christ’s enemies, and to the Gentiles, e.g., the Samaritan woman at the well, not minding the racial barrier existing between the two nations.\n\nJesus' goal was to bring all men to the knowledge of God and Himself. So, He went about doing good. He went about influencing His world through teaching in the synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. He identified the spiritual as well as the physical needs of the people and met those needs. When we encounter Christ, He teaches us to be compassionate because He is full of compassion. We are no longer tight-fisted, pitiless, miserly, and without kindness.\n\nLet compassion be your watchword from today. Reach out to your world as you tell and show them the love of Jesus. This is one mark of a compassionate believer. Discover a need everywhere you go—family, school, workplace, or community—and give back all the virtues that Christ has given you, and you will experience overflowing joy.",

Joseph cried as he considered the cost of forgiveness and the pain he went through because of their cruelty and bitter envy. However, he forgave his brothers and spoke kindly to them. What a forgiving heart!\n\nWhen couples practice forgiveness, they will truly bond together and become 'coupled' as God intended them to be. With every act of true forgiveness comes reconciliation, rehabilitation, restoration, and renewal. The relationship becomes better than where it was before the offence. If a couple forgives each other as prescribed, they will live, grow, and conquer territories and the enemies of their home. They will enjoy unending victory in their relationship. When they pray, their prayers will not be hindered (1 Peter 3:7).\n\nEvery friendship and relationship that will last must enjoy the ability of the parties to forgive readily.

Listen attentively when others (your spouse, children, friends, business partners, or colleagues) are speaking. Be quick to hear, a ready listener always open to hear beyond the words to the hidden nuances and body language. Listen with the intention to hear, not with a plan for your response. You may pick more than just the words when you are an active listener, and that may be the solution to a lingering issue. Be slow to talk, think through what you have heard, and be slow to react; do not take offence easily.\n\nIn the passage today, Jesus took time to process the points presented against the adulterous woman brought to Him by the Jewish leaders.

These are traceable to lack of mutual respect and honour for one another.\n\nThe Message translation puts our focus verse thus: 'Out of respect for Christ, be courteously reverent to one another.' This implies that Christ and His principles must form the basis for how we live in the family and how we relate in society. Submission is a word that has been so abused that humanity is beginning to rebel against it. We are to live in submission to one another, respecting one another out of respect for Christ. When we refuse to obey this injunction, we are negating our profession of submission to Christ.\n\nReverence for one another is an essential Christian principle for healthy relationships, whether in the home or in society.

So, we are fighting from a vantage position.\n\nMarriage is spiritual, and we must be alert to fight this spiritual fight over our family relationships with all our might. Sleeping on the battlefield is an expensive act of carelessness. When men sleep, the enemy sows tares in the field. Tares signify any distractions or evil that cause trouble in the home. Worldly practices and principles are opposed to marital success. Be alert to the wiles of the enemy. The devil and his allies do not want any relationship to succeed.

He never develops anxieties or palpitations over any issues of life—on the earth beneath or in heaven above. Peace is His nature. And our Lord Jesus is called the Prince of Peace.\n\nBecause He is the God of all peace, He exudes peace all around and He can give it to as many people as are deprived. If we must seek the original peace, then it must come from the Lord. Therefore, the first peace we need on earth is the peace with God.

He would not thrust them out of the sheepfold, leaving them unprotected to be devoured by the wolf (Isaiah 42:3).\n\nWe need to treat a weak brother or an erring sister who has been bruised by the devil on the battlefield of life with an intention to revive and restore. This is the way to ensure that the kingdom forces are not depleted. We must not brush them aside, leaving them to rot in their weaknesses. We must not destroy the little hope of restoration left in them by exposing them to the brutal judgement of the world and, more recently, the dagger of the social media. Let us nurse their spiritual wounds till they are healed and strong enough to rejoin the Lord’s army.\n\nBeloved, desist from discussions where a brother is exposed to human judgement. Many use this trend on social media to draw 'likes' and subscriptions. Rather, choose to pray for the straying soul to come back home. Remember how Jesus prayed for Peter’s restoration (Luke 22:31-32) and how Aquila and Priscilla strengthened Apollos (Acts 18:26).",

    "text": "The Asian church here described was the church in Philadelphia. Jesus Christ bore record concerning them that they were a faithful church amid persecutions even though they had a little strength. Little strength here may connote little physical or political influence, modest numerical size, or small financial capacity. Whatever it was, it did not become an excuse for non-performance. They remained faithful to the Lord. They kept His Word and did not deny His name. For this reason, the Lord pronounced His blessing upon them.\n\nIf a man is waiting until he reaches his full capacity before he takes the first step to achieve his purpose in life, he would have lost a lot of time. Like the church described above, little strength—physical, spiritual, emotional, or financial—is all you need to begin to do the work of God. Remain faithful to His Word in need or in surplus. Be instant in season and out of season. Stand on the promises of Christ and never let go. Cling to Calvary’s cross with the little strength and refuse to let go until He endues you with power from on high (Luke 24:49).\n\nWhile you are at it, the door of greatness and strength will be opened unto you. The Lord, who knows your limitation, will come to give you a limitless offer of help. Remember He has the key of David; He opens, and no one shuts; He shuts, and no one opens. Hold on; don’t you quit now because help is right on its way for you.",

Whenever the opportunity presents itself to us, let our desire be to show someone the light of Christ first by our actions and then through our words as we minister to their spiritual needs too.\n\nThe vices in the world today, especially among young people, can be attributed to poor neighbourliness. We have shown little care about the souls of these confused, young lives in our society. They are involved in all kinds of experimentation because their souls are crying for help daily—any help. Sadly, we are too busy with how to make ends meet. Finally, they got false help in alcohol, drugs, and sexual perversion, which further ruined their physical, mental, and spiritual health. Oh, that we had discerned the yearning in their hearts and given them Jesus!\n\nDo not wait to be neighboured; neighbour somebody who is in need.

He was terribly angry at his wife. Then he saw a note she put by his pillow: 'It’s 6:00am, wake up!' Such is the consequence of not communicating well because of unresolved conflict.\n\nThis may sound funny, but it typifies what happens in some marriages. There are people who have lost golden opportunities because of offences they have refused to forgive or issues they will not resolve. A woman reportedly died because her husband, with whom she had a quarrel earlier in the day, did not check what caused the delay in her coming into the house after she parked her car. How many Christian couples live in malice at home while they dress in matching outfits to church, presenting a false front to the people? God is not mocked.\n\nBeyond losing opportunities, living in hypocrisy can cost you eternity. It may feel good to win an argument or be proved right in your judgment of the facts, but at what cost? Every Christian home is to be a model to the people around us—neighbours, friends, younger people, and especially our children.",

If not properly managed, it can destabilise the parties involved and impact negatively on other people around them, especially the children in the home. When we refuse to forgive the wrongs that have been done to us, we also block the path to receiving God’s forgiveness. It has been reasonably hypothesized that how we handle our marital relationship is a key factor to where an individual will spend eternity. This is because of the prolonged impact, spanning decades, that spouses have on each other.\n\nWhen there is an unresolved issue, make the first move. Remember that the greater begs the lesser. God made the first move at reconciliation even though man sinned. Even when you opined that your spouse is in the wrong, your first move at restoring the relationship is a mature and healthy way to live. Jesus said: 'go first and be reconciled, then return and be accepted.' The point here is, don’t wait for the other person to make the first move. If your marital relationship and your relationship with the Lord are important to you, make peace with your spouse.\n\nThe relationship between couples is likened to that between Christ and the church. Man went astray and God sent His Son to come and 'beg' us. Let’s be like God in this. Make every effort to reconcile and not live in malice. Let sincere apology be as free as air in the home. However, do not take each other for granted. Be ready to make amends where wrong.",

They want to please God but do not want to hurt the devil. They want to live in the light and still do works of darkness. They lack impact: God cannot feel them; the devil is not proud of them.\n\nA major setback to spiritual fervency is keeping company with God-haters or people with a lukewarm attitude towards the things of God. If your friends are not enthusiastic about the things of God or make light the seriousness of matters of the Christian faith, you need to change them immediately. They will gradually pull you away from commitment to godly principles. Be bold to say, 'No!' to unholy alliances because you are commissioned by God to show forth His praises.
