        "CONCLUSION": "You can have a loving relationship before and during conflict. Due to different personalities or life experiences, you’ll never make it to a complete resolution i.e. agree on everything.  You can disagree without being disagreeable. We need to be peacemakers, though Conflict is everywhere or may never end but we could let the Lord use us to resolve conflict when it arises, this is a decision that honors Jesus."

Living in peace is both an outward (a way of life where one respects and loves others in spite of differences) and an inward process (a way of life where one searches the heart and mind and understands the fear that causes impulse for violence). When we continue to ignore the rage within, the storm outside will never subside. However, some basic steps can help us to discover and journey in peace.",

At the end of the day, living in peace will be mine and your own conscious choice as our duty prescribes."
